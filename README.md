Module 9 Challenge

Here are my files for the Module 9 Challenge covering SQL. The 'erd_diagram' shows the outline for my tables, and the 'table_schemata' creates them. The data to import into those tables can be pulled from the CSV files in the 'data' folder. Lastly, the 'queries_data_analysis' will pull up each of the solutions to the prompts in the challenge. 

Cheers!
